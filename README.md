# Notify

Notify is a service developed by the [Digital Transformation Agency](https://www.dta.gov.au) that helps
government agencies communicate with their users.

This is the open source repository that encompasses all projects that make up
Notify.

## Running the things

We can orchestrate all of these projects by using a set of common Makefile
conventions.

The targets that every sub-project should implement are:

- `install`
- `install-dev`
- `build`
- `test`
- `clean`
- `deploy`
- `deploy-dev`
- `check-vulnerabilities`

Issuing any of these commands at the root level will forward it on to all
sub-projects. For example, you can set up and build every project by running:

```
make install
make build
```

You can run all the tests of all projects by running:

```
make install-dev
make test
```

You can also work with a specific project from the root level by prefixing the
command with the project name, and a full stop separator.

For instance, to run the API in dev mode:

```
make api.run
```

Alternatively, you can change into the `api` directory and issue the `make run` command directly.

To start the whole app from nothing, you'll need to run the following in
different shells.

```
make api.run-celery-worker
make admin.run
```

... then hit up http://localhost:6012 to get going.

Optionally you can also run this target to run the scheduled tasks:

```
make api.run-celery-beat
```

## Requirements

Different projects have different needs. Consult them individually to be sure.

Generally though, you'll need Python and pipenv for the frontend and backend.

You'll need Node.js for the frontend and docs.

## Credits

Notify is based on [GOV.KAO Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.KAO).

Thanks GDS team for providing Notify as an open source project that made it
possible for us to build on a stable and reliable foundation.
